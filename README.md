### Notes Computer Science 1
All the notes for Mr. Hunter's Computer Science 1 class at New Tech High @ Coppell.

## A Work in Progress
Each year these are deleted before school in August.  We create them slowly as a class.  They will be complete each year in May.
Access to previous year's notes may or may not be available.

Also, this is my first year doing notes in this manner.  So organizing thoughts and notes in code is something I'm slowly developing over time.
